# Link preview generator

Generates link previews as HTML for a list of space-separated URLs

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:shawninder/link-preview.git
$ cd link-preview
$ node bin/preview <urls...>
```

This will output some HTML. Next, you will need a bit of css: [these example styles](style.css) are a good place to start.

Finally, don't forget to review the results as this process won't get things right every time.
